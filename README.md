## Project: Algorithmic Tasks using Recursion and Functions

This project contains 10 algorithmic problems implemented in Java, focusing on functions and recursive solutions.  
Each task is designed to solve a specific computational problem such as mathematical calculations, array processing, or string validation.

The goal of this project is to strengthen understanding of:
- Recursive thinking
- Function design
- Time complexity analysis
- Problem-solving with Java

Each task includes:
- A clear problem statement  
- A Java method implementation  
- Proper documentation and comments  
- Time complexity analysis  

This project is part of the ADS (Algorithms and Data Structures) course laboratory work.
